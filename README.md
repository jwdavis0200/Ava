# Ava: Your Personal GPT Artificial Virtual Assistant

![Image of UI of Ava](./images/ava.png)

This is a personal project done over a period of 2 weeks for the MVP, to leverage on the insanely game-changing LLM model openai ```gpt-3.5-turbo``` and the open-source ```langchain``` library. The application is written in Python and built using ```customtkinter``` library to create a modern UI.


## Note:
As the import libraries were not optimised to ensure the quickest launch time, please wait for a bit when launching the app.

On first launch, an api set up window will be launched alongside with the main app. Please input your openai key(for general chat functionality).
